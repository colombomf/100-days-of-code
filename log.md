# 100 Days Of Code - Log


---
### Day 10: April 15, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  I successfully implemented a tweet intent function in my project.
**Thoughts**: During the implementation, I faced formatting challenges that required the use of string manipulation techniques. Specifically, I used the method of replacing HTML line break tags with newline characters ('\n') in my code. By utilizing this method, I was able to achieve the correct line breaks and deliver the desired output.

### Day 9: April 14, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  I added the Fisher-Yates algorithm to my project to shuffle arrays and avoid repeated quotes.

### Day 6: April 11, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I added resizable multimedia support and a font that adapts to fit the length of each quote.

### Day 5: April 10, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I utilized the Fetch method to retrieve data from the backend server and initiated work on the client-side to allow real-time updates to the user interface.

**Thoughts**  Now that the back-end API is working, it's time to build out the front-end application to display the data.

### Day 4: April 09, Sunday
 
**Today's Progress**: I've just completed a comprehensive round of testing on the Cyberpunk 2077 API endpoints using Insomnia and they all checked out great.

**Thoughts** Now that the back-end API is working perfectly, it's time to build out the front-end application to display the data.

### Day 3: April 08, Saturday
 
**Today's Progress**:  I recently upgraded my Node.js application from using the Express framework to create a simple REST API that served data from a JSON object in memory, to using MongoDB as the database and Mongoose to model the data. This switch has allowed for improved scalability and flexibility in managing the application's data.

**Thoughts**: The code is now better organized, cleaner, and fetch operations are faster compared to storing the data in an object in memory.

### Day 1: April 06, Thursday
 
**Today's Progress**: Successfully deployed my React-based landing page to Firebase.

**Thoughts** Wireframing has been super helpful in giving me a visual of the landing page design, but creating a prototype is turning out to be harder than writing the code itself.
